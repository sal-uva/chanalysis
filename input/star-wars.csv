The Wook puts them down as being roughly twice as large as a Neb-B, albeit with more mass. This would put it in the range of a cruiser or heavy cruiser. Since we see one of these ships take a dud shot from the Galaxy Gun with minimal damage in Dark Empire, we can assume their hulls are somewhat tougher than most Mon Cal ships. It also has landing gear, much like the similarly-sized Acclamator.
Since most Mon Cal warships during the GCW were converted from civilian craft, I'd argue that this ship is a militarized mining vessel/ore hauler. The thicker hull is a defense against asteroid impacts, while the landing gear would allow it to land directly on large planetoids to deploy vehicles and equipment. Since the Alliance was known to modify bulk cruisers into starfighter carriers in Legends, this ship could possibly have filled that same role.",,Anonymous,MCQ-mccruiser.jpg,GUaqDMyNwUKBNtNqb6Nu4A==,

As a general rule, the Rebellion usually tried to avoid fighting ISDs at all unless absolutely necessary. If they had to kill an ISD, the best route was to hit it while it was alone and swarm it with torpedo craft while Rebel warships drew its fire. Otherwise, it was generally best to just hit the objective the SD was protecting and run away afterward. Once the NR started rolling, conventional naval engagements became easier to handle thanks to greater resources and more shipyards to churn out carriers and tanky MCs.",,Anonymous,,,

I am an idiot and missed the ""Super"" in that post. The Rebellion didn't try to start fights with SSDs at all until Endor. It was always better to avoid SSDs entirely. It wasn't until they became the New Republic that SSD-sized hulls became viable targets. Most of the time, the NR was content to let the warlords bash their SSDs against one another except for Lusankya, Iron Fist, and Razor's Kiss. Lusankya was isolated, worn down by mass torpedo strikes and a turncoat ISD, then ultimately forced into surrender after NR reinforcements jumped in to save the Rogues. Iron Fist was countered by a joint NR-IR operation involving over a hundred starfighters, multiple MCs and ISDs, and a whole lot of smaller escorts. Razor's Kiss was not combat-ready and died via self-destruct after Wraith Squadron sabotage.",,Anonymous,,,

Worst Order has built a new Space Destructor cannon, as big as an entire solar system, capable of destroying the space-time fabric of the galaxy itself once fired. Hux raves about a new reich while drool flows down his chin as the weapon sucks in one star after another, charging up to fire. Rey uses the force to juggle MonCal cruisers full of Resistance personnel, then directs them to hyper-ram the Space Destructor. Everyone, including the Ghost of Jake, finally acknowledges just how great she always was. The end.

Everything to do with Cade ""Dark Side is Super Saiyan"" Skywalker and Darth ""Somehow Boring Edgelord"" Krayt, as well as the shit-tier ship designs (aside from the Pellaeon-class), basically. The Fel Empire and Galactic Alliance Remnant were neat, though.

Also, a Sith resurgence goes against the Prophecy of the Chosen One. which bothers me. You could argue the One Sith were basically unsanctioned wannabes based on Krayt's interaction with the Sith holocrons, but they still fit the role.

I found FotJ mostly just kinda boring. The Luke/Ben bonding aspect was the only part I found entertaining, and I even liked Vestara Khai, though I feel she should've been a member of a Dark Jedi cult instead of a direct descendant of the Golden Age Sith, for the same reason I gave with the One Sith. I also felt she was sort-of wasted at the end of the story. Their whole subplot should've just been its own little trilogy.

Abeloth was silly; not terrible exactly, I just felt she was out of place (although retconning her into the Mother made her a bit more interesting).

FotJ also continued the trend of ""only the Skywalkers and Solos are important, no one else!"" and continues to shove a lot of formerly-major EU characters to the background, like the Horn and Antilles families.

The sub-plot of Jag stepping down from head of the Empire was also completely unnecessary. It was absolutely forced and handwaved as to why he became leader in the first place at the end of LotF, but it was clearly done to set up the Fel Empire in the Legacy comics. Having Jag fight a whole civil war with Daala over leadership of the Remnant, only for him to win and abdicate, despite the fact that all the readers know he's just going to come back some time later and form the Fel Dynasty, was needlessly contrived.",,Anonymous,,,

Based on all of the tiresome argueing on here, there is an audience for it. I personally find the ST deeply disappointing and sometimes distasteful; but I'm happy for anyone who gets enjoyment from it, and hope they get the product support they want.

>Crimson Empire I: Nearly every character is a moron, and the plot only moves because of that.

>Crimson Empire III: Mostly solid art, but the New Republic being threatened by an Imperial splinter so small that its entire force inhabits a small moon.

The character path of Kir Kanos also bothers me. His conflict with Carnor Jax over the latter sabotaging the Palpatine clones is a great motivator, but Kanos just turning to bounty hunter work seems very unfitting for a former Royal Guard. I feel like his end should've been through a failed attempt to kill Luke Skywalker or joining with the Imperial Remnant and protecting what remained of Palpatine's legacy.

What is the purpose of the high tempo? The movies have a lot quiter moments intersped with set pieces. Or is it about snap judgements so ""making the paladin fall"" becomes easier?
Quieter moments are for building up tension, being the guys sneaking under the wire, ad-lib comedy or getting some info out of npc's with social interactions

The reason I run a higher tempo for combat and conflict is simple- 
>the Initiative System
In other systems when you roll ini, everyone sits around waiting for Bob to get his fucking shit together looking up some kind of feat, weapon damage, spell or some crap he thinks makes a difference... and it drags stuff out for days.
In FFG, you go look up your shit in your time, someone with Initiative and an idea to do something, means that while Bob is off getting his shit together and you've got an idea- take it right now if no one has anything better to do
that way you just get through so much more in-game than with other systems and its a small design blessing I hammer on really hard, they need to do as much as they can, when they can and in order of what they think will be most effective, its literally the reason for me as a GM that the FFG system really just is miles ahead of some of the others",,Redback,btlc.gif,s5JvAJ+3YfhLSiptlobLEw==,

That's actually a problem I have, too, and I plan to make Duros very common in my campaign.

I mean, hell, the lore makes it sound like they're about as numerous as humans, Zabraks, and Twi'leks, yet we hardly see them anywhere.

Granted, Star Wars in general is often pretty bad about making use of non-human characters.

In my games I like to make duros ubiquitous on the legal side of the shipping business, but they're scarce in the circles where most PCs move.
Like if they were hauling a completely legal small shipment of shirts or candy bars or furniture off a bulk freighter groupage from the sector freight terminal to a small colony somewhere, they'd probably be dealing with a duros shipping agent, a duros captain on the bulk freighter, and possibly a duros running the warehouse on the other end, but there wouldn't be one in sight on a smuggling job",,Anonymous,,,

Had a full-blown flashback at one point when I went in for a colonoscopy, something about the smell of the detergent in the toilet. Forgot where I was for a moment, thought it was three years ago again.

I say I'm off my meds, I just ran out of some and it took a few days for the next prescription to come in. Took my pills again earlier, and mostly feel better.

U-Wing is great, though, no arguments there. Can't really remember why I just stopped building it like two-thirds of the way through, I think I just lost interest in it.

Following the events of TLJ, Kylo goes back to a world he's visited once before. An old world, called Malachor, that's had so many battles fought over it and on it that the place is like a sinkhole of the dark side. The Sith came there at some point, built a great pyramidical temple on the southern hemisphere in aeons past that stands surrounded by petrified figures all cringing away from it, whether in terror or supplication nobody can tell.

There are other ancient battlefields there also, places where the shattered ruins of ancient ships lie alongside suits of ancient Mandalorian armour and rusted lightsabers, all half-buried in the black sand, so many that it's all but impossible to walk on. Kylo comes there again seeking purpose, some way of finding out how he can shore up his weakening grasp on the First Order, and make himself an equal to the last jedi.

Whilst there, stalking through the ruins, he comes across another, a hooded figure picking its way through the rusted remains of Mandalore's finest. Kylo accosts them, demanding to know why they're there, but the figure is unperturbed.

""You seek knowledge?"" it asks, and Kylo lights his saber, angling it so the red light from the spitting blade illuminates what's under the figure's hood.

Eh, you know that people would still be pissed off with it if a fifty dollar bill was left on all their cinema seats and the movie paused periodically to dispense boxes of chocolates and headpats.

As such, go hard or go home, that's why my best idea for a continuation to TLJ eventually involves Rey visiting Tython and a rogue element of the Resistance deploying Project Blackwing against the FO's homeworlds.",,Anonymous,,,

Yes. But on the other hand, your Poe is still getting hit so hard that he's taking damage cards. Which given the amount of points he's definitely going to cost feels like this should be a contingency scenario rather than something you plan for.
Realistically, what should happen is that in that scenario, you want your opponent to focus on Bastian instead of Poe like a pseudo-Biggs. So that means you HAVE to build Bast in a way that makes him a legit threat if you don't forcus him.

And I worry about how point efficient that sort of build would probably be. I mean, just put Predator and BB's on both Poe and his Wingman and use your actions to arc dodge and rely on close range bullseye's for your dice mods. Or take Jess and G8 and TL Poe. Jess get's her reroll from being close to Poe anyway.",,Anonymous,,,

You, as four people, go from the first ground troops on Geonosis to assassinating Sun Fac in about ten minutes, disable a droid factory, destroy a core ship, clear out an entire Republic cruiser filled with elite Trandoshan mercenaries and battle druids, and finally are the spearhead for the Republic ""aid"" to Kashyyyk. The entire time the team is yelling out various racial slurs against their enemies, including calling the Geonosians ""filthy bugs"" while throwing thermal detonators in their nursery and casually comparing kill counts.

Which means these guys would make fantastic enemies to chase down the players. What's some good ways to implement Republic Commandos (or the later Imperial Commandos) into a game?

Give them their full in-game arsenal, fight dirty, fight smart, and don't be afraid to put the fear of death in the PCs. Adapt their tactics as necessary. PCs who are dug in might find themselves pinned in place with suppressing fire from half the team while the other half flanks, pushes up, and/or tries to flush them out with grenades. If the PCs are indoors, expect breaching charges and even more grenades. In close quarters, they'll get really aggressive thanks to their shields and heavy armor. At long range, expect volleys of sniper and anti-tank fire. They'll try to shoot through thin walls, remain in constant communication, focus the Wookiee down with their heaviest ordnance, and retreat if the situation isn't to their liking. With their regenerating shields, incredible durability, portable revive gubbins, and a steady supply of bacta, they can keep coming back for another fight anyway. Also, watch their spacing so the entire team doesn't get wiped out by a single explosion.

If you're feeling really mean, round out their kit with other toys from across the franchise. Portable probe droids from Battlefront 2 will let them scout out their targets beforehand and maybe call down pinpoint orbital strikes. Maybe instead of the DC-17m, one of them brings a gatling blaster. Maybe they all brought jetpacks. Maybe they packed smoke grenades or suppressed slugthrowers with armor-piercing ammo. Maybe the team sniper brought a cut-down starfighter laser cannon to use as an anti-materiel fuck-you from a kilometer away.",,Anonymous,rainbow six planning.png,lJvb+aWPPHcD6v4AywFGrg==,

>So, from what I'm seeing, NPCs can occasionally be given Boost dice. What does one do to distinctify them from the player Boost dice in the pool? Roll PC and NPC separately?

If an NPC is taking an action against a PC, build a dice pool for the GM to roll:

The NPC's ability score and skill ranks contribute green and yellow dice in the usual way (remembering that effective skill ranks for Minions are based on the current size of the Minion group).

Green dice can be upgraded to yellow through Talents/equipment/flipping a Destiny point from black to white.

Blue dice are added for miscellaneous helpful circumstances, just like when PCs act.

Add purple dice equal to the checks difficulty... unless it's an opposed check (e.g. NPC Stealth opposed by PC Perception); in that case take the PC's skill and switch green dice to purple and yellow to red... that's the base difficulty. Purple can upgrade to red based on things like the PC's Talents, or the PC's flipping a Destiny point from white to black.

Black dice are added for miscellaneous hindering circumstances, just like when PCs act.

I think that pretty much covers the pool, so roll it.

It sounds a lot slower than it is, especially when you're typing it on a phone.",,Anonymous,,,

I generally try not to have full RC/IC teams attack the PCs unless they're all dedicated to combat, since the enemy commandos act as their equivalent of the Psycho Rangers and the playing field is more equal. If you have noncombatant classes, maybe save the competent commandos for endgame fights. That way, they'll have the resources to even the playing field. Give the social PCs time to amass a following of loyal meat shields and let the tech boys come to the fight with pimped rides, gadgets, and droids.

It also begs the question of why you would have an armored pickup truck instead of separating those duties into a regular assault gun and a regular speeder truck.

okay, I got a challenge for you guys since, by all rights, Lucas NEVER WANTED to explore this:

What would be your personal canon about what Yoda's species is? If you ran a game where you were forced to ultimately make something up, what would you come up with?

My own idea would be that Yoda's people are basically Space Hobbits. They come from a pastoral world (not without it's own dangers) and live a life of agriculture, ranching, and simplicity and don't really think too much about the world beyond theirs except for the extremely rare trader that might come by.

This easy-going lifestyle and lack of attatchment on materialism outside of the basic comforts does lead to a strong disposition towards Force Users, but it's rare their kind actually does agree to go with the Jedi to hone this ability, those that do cannot return. Not that they're banned, but it is like Frodo after the events of Lord of the Rings, innocence is lost and they just can't connect to their old lifestyle anymore and fear ruining it for others.

Start with the Thrawn trilogy.
After that, move to the X-wing series; they're not crucial to the meta-narrative, but they're pretty good and entertaining. Especially if you're into Alliance military shennanigans, these are what you want. Keep in mind that they start before the Thrawn trilogy and end significantly after so you'll be jumping around the timeframe a bit, but it's pretty straightforward. (Note that Mercy Kill takes place some 30+ years after the rest.)
Read, skim, or summarize Courtship of Princess Leia. It's not great, but it's charming, and some of the events are important, especially if you're curious what ends up happening to Zsinj (one of the antagonists from the X-wing books)

From there, read the Jedi Academy Trilogy OR I, Jedi, or both if you want; they cover a lot of the same major events but they're both not to everyone's taste. I, Jedi is a first-person story told by one of Stackpole's pet characters from the X-wing books, so if you like his writing already, like his characters, and/or are interested in a first-person account of becoming a Jedi, it's a fun read. The trilogy by KJA is a more traditional narrative following Luke training the first generation of the new Jedi, but personally I can't stand KJA's writing. I know a lot of people feel the opposite, though, so look into both options.

Darksaber is another love-or-hate it story by KJA. It's also not terribly crucial but it's worth a mention.

From there, read the Hand of Thrawn duology and then possibly Survivor's Quest if you want a fun Luke & Mara story. That concludes the essentials of the pre-NJO era; some of the rest are worth checking out, but those are the highlights, specifically when it comes to Jedi and Rebels.",,Anonymous,,,

FFG's range system is deliberately fluid and vague and is intended to slide with the environment. That is to say, the ""short"" range band inside a building doesn't necessarily represent the same physical distance as ""short"" range in an open desert plain. It's kind of up to the needs of the encounter.

In general, ""engaged"" is a little wider than DnD's threatened squares: you're close enough that you can use melee weapons, and close enough that some ranged weapons are difficult to use, but you're not necessarily toe-to-toe. ""Short"" range is out of melee range but close enough that even a novice with a blaster isn't likely to miss. ""Medium"" range is too far to throw most objects, and ""Long"" and ""Extreme"" ranges should be self-explanatory.

It's worth noting that moving from Engaged to Short, or Short to Medium, takes a single maneuver. Moving from Medium to Long, or Long to Extreme, takes two maneuvers; the distance those bands cover is essentially doubled. In addition, vehicles and starships each use their own set of even broader range bands.

If I were to half-ass it I'd say ""Engaged"" should be 0-2 squares, ""Short"" 3-10 squares, ""Medium"" 11-20 squares, ""Long"" 21-40 squares, and ""Extreme"" 41+ squares, with one maneuver being roughly 10 squares movement (and the caveat that you can't move directly from Medium to Engaged on a single maneuver). You might have to shift things around a bit until it feels right though, and I'd definitely encourage using the grid more as a guideline than a rule that's set in stone.",,Anonymous,,,

I disagree. The NJO is young, the GCW doesn't end until 19 ABY, and the galaxy is a big place. If the PT OJO was spread thin during the Clone Wars, then the NJO is going to be spread even thinner. Full parties of Jedi PCs would be quite far-fetched barring emergencies like defending the Jedi Temple.

I suppose that's fair. The main thing I'm going for is following the lead of the vidya and having two students per master, and so far only two of the five players have said they're almost certainly going to be Jedi, so it works out. One is definitely not going to be a Force user, but the other two are wildcards.

If nothing else, maybe I'll lean on them and say I'd like to keep the party limited, but I'll bow to popular pressure if they push for it hard. I don't think they will, though, since they know I'd be doing it for the purposes of narrative and nothing else.",,Anonymous,,,

The problem is that the range bands are specifically non-linear. The distance between medium and long range is greater than the distance between short and medium range. It takes twice as much movement to go from Medium to Long as it does to move from Short to Medium; it would take 6 total maneuvers to go from Engaged to Extreme, because Medium>Long and Long>Extreme both cost two.

The non-linear part is where ""more-or-less,"" with the 3 hexes being for Small and Medium. Something like,

>Engaged: 0 tiles away
>Small: 1-3 tiles away
>Medium: 4-6 tiles away
>Long: 7-12
>Extreme: 13+

But depending on how my players feel, I'll probably just simplify it so each tile represents the turn it takes to move through it. so,

Engaged: 0 tiles away

Houses are the 'ruling' force on Mandalore, allied clans forming up the basis of the house's numbers. So during the Empire era it was house Vizsla and the leading clan inside the house was Saxon with a couple of other large ones with them. Prior to that it was House Kryze. There's also little cadres running around Mandalore which aren't clans or part of a house and have their own agendas- Deathwatch, Night Owls etc. Which are usually more of a political or ideological thing rather than a family association.",,Redback,Mandalore-Kaga.jpg,Yze/rDAekLxC7V6WHkILmw==,

Is your group deeply invested in the tactical miniatures approach to combat? Mine did that all day long in our D&D 3.0/3.5 days, but now that we're playing SW, we rarely even have a sketch of the scene, let alone a battlemat and minis. The FFG system just seems suited to a narrative and dramatic approach to the fights, rather than a mechanical, technical one.

I genuinely think the first 3 episodes of Resistance are better then rebels. I was not hugely excited at big Jedi cast, Kessel looking awful, Kallus feeling like a hilariously cowardly villain considering the pilot ends with him kicking a back talking stormtrooper to his death, and the episode or two immediately afterwards were really eye rollingly bad. I like the mysteries Resistance is setting up, I enjoy that unlike with Ezra team Fireball doesn't immediately take a liking to Kaz and their relationships need to develop and grow up, I like that Kaz needs to develop skills he's clearly not naturally good at and I appreciate that we're getting to explore a timeline we don't know a bunch about. I really liked rebels, but I'm not going to pretend the meloo run episode was any better then 'watch out for seedy friends' very special episode of the week. I think Resistance has a better setting starting out, and while a lot of the characters in Resistance aren't as immediately interesting they aren't as annoyingly special as any of the rebels characters.",,Anonymous,,,

In the first 3 episodes, Zeb also felt weirdly special. He has a blaster/lightsaber blocking quarter staff, he was bigger and stronger then everyone at no real downside, and he was the last surviving member of his species. His connection to Kallus in episode 3 felt really forced, and I was not excited for more episodes where it would clearly be a Kallus/Zeb rivalry episode. The rest of the show really turned me around, but by the end of droids in Distress I was downright worried about where Rebels was going. We had 3PO and R2 shoved in 2 episodes in and this weird rivalry between some bumfuck security officer and the last surviving member of a species felt way too overblown for something this early on. Rise of the Old Masters was the first Rebels episode that blew me back on my ass, to be clear, but until then I was mostly watching the show waiting for it to get good. Though I will note looking back Droids in Distress had Kanan and Ezra training on a hovering Ghost, which looked really damn good, so its not like the first 3 rebels episodes were all bad to me.",,Anonymous,,,

The rebel 1300 gains 1 primary and 2 shields, but it pays *32* points more than the scum version for *just* that. Like, hello?

In contrast, the Firespray gets a free engine upgrade, +1 primary (3 fore/3 aft is basically a bowtie), +1 agi / +1 shield / -2 hull (easily a wash for +1 agi, if not a trade up, *before* the extra shield), and gains red reinforce - and it pays 20 points for the privilege. That feels about right. 

Conversely, the Firespray is 10 points LESS than the rebel 1300, despite GAINING engine upgrade and red reinforce. The -2 hull / -1 shield for +1 agi is a wash (I mean, not on Boba, but we're talking about the raw frame).

It's the same with most of the other ""bad"" larges. Why is a contracted scout *20 points more* than a Y-Wing, for +1 shield, +1 agi, and a mobile arc? Why is a Decimator nearly as expensive as two lambdas? Why is a Shadowport Hunter 21 points more than Omicron Group Pilot? Why is a Wild Space Fringer nearly double the price of Redline with Proton Torpedos?

I think the Scum Falcon is so much more appropriately costed just because it was playtested more recently. You can put its statline next to a Y-Wing and say ""yeah, 1.5x the price feels about right"".",,Anonymous,,,

Stick with Thrawn Trilogy, 1/4 of the NJO books, X-Wing, and the novelizations. KOTOR-era and some CW era stories are fine.

Dark Empire and Jedi Academy are on the fence. Some people love them, some people hate them.

Avoid most other things if you're not looking for so-bad-it's-funny reads. Most of everything else isn't crucial and can easily be ignored from the continuity.

>Can someone give me a quick rundown of tips for building an FFG RPG character? All I’ve heard is that you want to buy up your Characteristics at the start and that face characters are XP-starved. Just some broad 101 advice would be helpful.

Man, That's tough to answer without context. Are you experienced in RPGs? If so, are you experienced in point-buy systems and skill-based systems?

How to approach building your character depends on how your GM and group play. Are they at the character/role play end of the spectrum or the optimized-mechanics/powergame end of it?

If roleplay, just walk through the build steps in the book, and make each choice guided by a character concept and/or what seems cool or fun to you. This system is quite tolerant of changing your mind about what's important as you play, so don't get too hung up on making the right choices up front (but yeah, buy characteristics during chargen).

It's harder if the group is about optimization and pwning challenges. If your character needs some versatility, it's hard to beat buying a bunch of stats up to 3; if you want to put your eggs in one basket for a focused chacter, like a Brawn melee fighter or an Intellect savant, starting with a 4 can be really satisfying.

Try to work out how to get what you want with your starting Specialization plus one more; three Specs is stretching, and any more requires a long game with tons of XP to get a return on investment.

There are some gane-changing Talents available, but you'll feel like a chump if you don't invest enough in your chosen skills to get reliable results.",,Anonymous,,,

""It is always up to the GM whether a given template is available to a PC. As a general rule of thumb, most templates should be available to the PC's a majority of the time""

Restricting templates to keep things from getting out of hand, or to create adventure hooks or rewards is one thing. Going a year and a half without getting something like the template for blaster pistols, or ANY other template whatsoever, suggests the GM should tell players that the crafting rules are not being used in that game.

So, if you want to go that route, I suggest making sure the GM is good with it, because there are lots of people who judge the crafting rules by the worst-case runaway examples that exist.

If the GM doesn't want to expend bandwidth on managing crafting in the game, that's a legitimate choice (if communicated).",,Anonymous,,,

Set the PCs in an isolated sector, or make them privateers/mercs who serve as ""deniable assets"" or freelancers instead of true enlisteds where helping them out would be a generosity rather than a duty for the Empire.

Even still the Empire didn't fall that rapidly, and technically it never really did. It existed alongside the New Republic until they confederated into the Space EU. It gives plenty of options for the players and even allows spec-op guerrilla-style campaigns on the Imperial side far more easily. Players can choose to join a different group, or the main Remnant. They can follow different rules of different leaders, be in different sectors with more desperate commanders against greater odds.

Forty years was where the timeline ended before it skipped to Legacy.

Its status as the Rebel Navy's workhorse bomber and starfighter scout (Longprobe) for most of the war, however, is also reminiscent of the SBD Dauntless. Further complicating things is the fact that it can either be a single-seater with all its guns fixed forward or a two-seater with a topside turret.",,Anonymous,,,

The way I do it, most of the important events in Legends content up to the campaign's starting point are campaign canon, and the campaign's start marks the point of divergence. Bits and pieces are thrown out as necessary to ensure the PCs aren't too weighed down by lore baggage. If the PCs are not around to mess with events in established lore, then those events also become campaign canon.

I'm basing the Y-wing comparisons on how they appear outside the films because, let's face it, the films barely go into under-the-hood shop talk or overall combat record during the war. We get a few brief shots of fighters doing things and then cut away to other stuff. And again, I add the caveat that it is dependent on the writer. Y-wings that are used by writers as outdated cannon fodder bombers do match the Devastator comparison. It would be incorrect to call the Y-wing a P-38 analogue specifically within the scope of works where the writer portrays them in a very non-P-38 fashion. Very few pieces of media show the Y doing a whole lot of dedicated anti-fighter duty. The Y-wing's speed is also inconsistent even among film production notes. There's also the fact that the turreted two-seater Y-wing (BTL-S3) has supplanted the OT's one-man, fixed-gun BTL-A4 in terms of popular perception. The Y was also the first into the DS1's trench, implying greater suitability for bombing than the T-65, who were originally meant to play escort. While the P-38 was one of the inspirations on the drawing board, in execution across the franchise it is more frequently seen in an attacker's niche.

Not very well. Its poor in-game maneuverability, speed, and boost make it sub-par at A2A and its two laser cannons make it difficult to one-shot TIEs. It also mostly shows up in missions where the primary objective is bombing and the fighters are just distractions.
>>kills TIEs in Empire at War
It doesn't, except maybe TIE Scouts. The game mechanics are designed such that Ys are hard-countered by fighters. When the numbers are 1:1, TIE/LNs will almost always trade favorably against Ys. It's meant more for killing warships.
>>kills TIEs in Battlefront II
Not very well. I don't remember whether its guns in that game were the hitscan beams with very small hitboxes or the hitscan short-ranged shotgun, but either weapon is less suited to anti-fighter duty due to low rate of fire and the Y's poor in-game agility and speed. Then again, Battlefront II is also a game where TIE/LNs are just reskinned X-wings complete with proton torpedoes.

Vader raised Starkiller to kill the Emperor, had him kill some Jedi as a dry run, the Emperor found out and Vader killed Star Killer to prevent the Emperor from wrecking his cyborg ass. The Emperor then came up with the plan to gather potential Rebel leaders in one place, and forced Vader to go along with it. Then, when the time came to kill them, Vader was supposed to kill Starkiller, and they could execute the leaders of the future Rebellion before it ever became a thing.

There's a better way to explain it.

Vader's on a Jedi hunt & after killing the Jedi there, discovers the Jedi's kid with lots of force potential. Vader decides to use that kid, train him & use him to hunt Jedi. After a few hunts, the kid thinks they can take down the Emperor but Vader pretend-betrays him to fake his death. A bit pissed but Vader has a new job. He knows that there is much anger against the Empire which would eventually become a Rebellion. Vader's plan was then to get them all in a single place so he can capture them all at once. The kid gathers the people, believing he's creating the Rebellion, only to find himself betrayed again & all the Rebels captured minutes after the Rebellion's founding. Pissed off, he decides to go on a one-man suicide mission to take down Vader & possibly free his allies. The results we see in the end game. End result, the Rebels are freed & form the Rebellion for real as he gives his life to aid their escape.",,Anonymous,,,

Except in the novels, where his primary role was to kill the warships that the Rogues could not kill. Salm’s squad dues are also pretty much just bomber jockeys in the novels. The times that Salm does kill fighters, he also uses the turreted two-seater S3 which again is not a good P-38 comparison.

That's literally what that video is showing, though?
Also, per the wook.
""However, there was a complication. One of the Star Destroyers survived the explosion and began plummeting towards the surface of Raxus Prime; directly at the ore cannon. Unable to get clear in time, Starkiller was advised by Kota to do something that even he judged to be insane; telekinetically pull the Star Destroyer out of the sky into a controlled crash. Initially considering this idea impossible, Starkiller ultimately opted to attempt it when reminded that compared to the Force, size and mass meant nothing. Focusing entirely on the cruiser, Starkiller began to adjust its flightpath. He had to correct on his initial changes, as he didn't want it to tumble or break apart. As Starkiller pulled the Destroyer down, he began to panic as the scale of his action started to overwhelm him,""",,Anonymous,,,

It has forward facing guns, can carry numerous payloads, and can double as a shuttlecraft.
Furthermore Star Wars has no real conception of a dedicated bomber a la the He 111 or B17 Flying Fortress - or at least it didn't until the T-wing Starfortresses of TLJ.

Same reason you emphasize the P-38 comparison. It’s a dispute of fact where the parties weigh conflicting facts and sources differently. I also noted initially that the analogue comparison was heavily dependent on personal interpretation and which general facts supported which. 
>everything
Except in lore books and games where people call it a bomber and use it mostly as a bomber. I don’t dispute the fact that the Y in its youth did serve as a fighter, but within the GCW’s scope, it did serve mostly as a naval bomber with occasional recon duties, much like the Scout Bomber Douglass, which did get some A2A action but primarily blew up ships. SBD and TBD even sound like the BTL designation, further lending credence to it leaning mostly towards the bomber side during the GCW.",,Anonymous,,,

Depends on where you draw the line in ""numbers"" and whether you consider the R-22 Spearhead part of the A-wing family. X-Wing's pre-Endor missions do allow the player to fly A-wings and engage in training against other A-wings (later retconned to be Spearheads). The T-65 appeared just as often in the flight sims as the BTL-A4. Also, that one Death Star novel featured a Lucrehulk loaded with hundreds of X-wings.

It's worth noting that, in canon, only one person who ever went to the dark side ever came back from it; that's how bad the dark side is.
You might be able to stretch it with a few good examples from the EU like Mara Jade coming back (but she was never that deep in) and Revan coming back (however temporary, dependent on player actions) but even that required a complete mindwipe and personality erasure that turned him into a fucking Bioshock 1 meatbaby.

Arguable.

>Executor being built in the middle of nowhere, without a shipyard or even protective fleet around it.
Because either of the Deathstars were built with shipyards or space-based infrastructure? Also, you don't need a protective fleet if nobody knows about the ship, and I was under the impression that the only things working on the ship were droids. Admittedly it's still stupid that it didn't have a fleet around to protect it.

>Jedi cloning technology perfected and mass-employed before DS was even finished.
Wasn't this part of TFU 2? Because yeah, that game was pretty shit. Still, weren't Spaarti Cylinders around at this time?

I don't see a problem with this.

>Hardlight holodroids that somohow perfectly imitate jedi, dark lords and anyone else they meet or hear of.
Dude you're exaggerating here and you know it. PROXY has the appearences and fighting styles of famous fighters and warriors, but that's it. He never once acts like them beyond that.

Yeah, this is pretty bad.

Eh. They had to learn about it from somewhere.

You were proven wrong about that last part in the last thread. Also, trashing Vader is a bit of an exaggeration.

Multiple times in pre-TFU lore, we see Executors needing shipyards to be constructed. See: Wraith Squadron, that one Fondor mission in the Rogue Squadron games, numerous comics, The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons, The Bacta War, Star Wars Insider, etc. The Wook describes the empty space where TFU's Executor is being built as a shipyard at Scarl but the scene shows no evidence of shipyards so I have no idea what the writers were going on about there.",,Anonymous,,,

Part of it is that her arguments are...not really super advanced. There is a lot of philosophers who've handled the topics she's bringing up in great detail and could pick apart her arguments.

Like her entire thing about morality is a lot of consequentialism (The end result of any action is what judges if it is good or evil) with a good chunk of negative responsibility (We are only responsible for our actions, choosing not to do something has no moral weight regardless of the consequences) and a bit of standard issue fictional Social Darwinist(Suffering builds strength, so by making people's lives easier you've prevented them growing in ways that would allow them to overcome future suffering).

From a mechanical standpoint, the fight could have been improved if dialogue had been incorporated into the fight to mechanically alter the course of battle, a la Shin Megami Tensei IV. I know it's unfair to bring up a game that was made years after in comparison, but the seeds of that mechanic were already planted in the Sion fight. The fight would have been much better if you could debate Kreia between phases and certain dialogue choices would debuff or buff one of the parties. Counter Kreia's point with something valid? Her stats weaken because she loses confidence in the path she chose. Counter with a logical fallacy? PC stats decrease because she shuts down your flawed argument and shakes the Exile's conviction. Something simple like that would have gone a long way towards improving the endgame.",,Anonymous,,,

According to the Wook, that's because Kuat and Fondor were both instructed to construct SSDs and there actually were two Executors under construction.

Suffering tends to degrade your ability to handle future suffering, rather than improve it as it leaves you with less resources, opportunities and general security to accept losses. Support is a much more effective system for helping people out of shitty situations than going 'Learn to get hard, with no real starting point for the first problem'.
>Determinism: This is a fundamentally unviable morality to use day to day, once you get outside of the most short term and simple options. You simply cannot predict how one situation will interact with another without a comical amount of precognition and pattern recognition on a large area. Determinism is fine for judging things in hindsight or for logic problems independent of a real world but beyond using some basic foresight, it can't be reasonably used for deciding current actions. Kreia takes such a long term 'but this good thing caused a much later bad thing' that it cannot work for active decision making, which makes it a kinda shitty morality system to use.
>Negative Responsibility: The issue with negative responsibility is that it separates 'action' and 'no action' in choices when choosing to take no action IS a choice of action in and of itself so if you're big on the determinism, you are actively making a choice with consequences and declaring that your particular choice wasn't actually a choice because it keeps your hands free of blood through splitting hairs.

If the thread is about when I wake up, I'll get some sources and try something a bit more complex and a bit less '3am vague philosophy thoughts about how I'd start an approach against her augments'.",,Anonymous,,,

Eh, I'm more inclined to think of it in similar terms to Aristotle, where the best place to stand is at a mid-point between the two extremes (as I understand it), the extremes here being the Light side and the Dark.

Both have their own draws, the dark gives you more power, whereas the light benefits those around you instead. Obviously different sorts of people would be drawn towards those two extremes, and it's easy to see why the Jedi would've decided that the light represents the highest good.

Only, both have drawbacks also. The dark leaves you a slave it and your base emotions in the end, only doing stuff to keep feeding your addiction to the power, regardless of whatever might have made you seek it out in the first place. The light, on the other hand, leaves you stuck, so focused on helping and appeasing those around you (a task which, at best, you'll be at forever, and which may well destroy you itself) that you neglect yourself and become regressive and stagnant, not to mention complacent.

As I see it, the only way to avoid both these drawbacks is to find the midpoint where they cancel each other out, allowing you to use the force without being pulled too far one way or the other.

Though, this is entirely my own interpretation of things, based on what I myself have seen of canon. You're perfectly within your rights to ignore it.",,Anonymous,RepublicBenduSymbol-AoI.png,NvxdRgyR8meOZuGznvP/Vg==,

Did you ever hear of the Platonic/Aristotelian ""Fallacy of the Middle Ground""? In an argument between good and evil, life and death, truth and lie, the best option is NOT a balance between them.

That has never been what greys were supposed to be about. It's what retards who want Force lightning with no repercussions think they are but that was never in any of Jolee's rhetoric.

I've never read the novelization (which allegedly wasn't nearly as bad), but there was an audiobook/radiodrama of sorts which was all kinds of awful that happened to be on air when I was a kid.

>because the cards don't specify a ""primary"" attack?

Yeah, that's how it works.

Honestly the amount of ships in most lists is probably somewhere around 3-4 right now. Although it can go higher for scum who started bulk buying Space-Tugs. TIE fighter Swarms aren't as common as I was expecting but we are seeing a lot of Redline and Punishers now as predicted, being one of the big winners of 2.0 upgrade after all, as well as a fair number of Barrage Rocket toting Bombers.

You generally don't see too many two ship lists, simply because that usually means somebody overloaded a large base ship, and those things are (with the exception of the Scum falcon) massively ineffecient for their points right now. Since a lot of the small ships went down in price, you can usually fit an additional decent pocket ace into a list where normally you'd only be able to fit two.

I prefer three ship lists since they give me the best margin for error whilst not cluttering up the board so much I end up ramming into myself too much, but that's personal preference and skill level.",,Anonymous,,,

Her work on Legacy of the Force is certifiably bad. The series itself is already not good without her involvement, but Traviss almost certainly made it worse, or at least did not make it any better.

The first two Republic Commando books are solid; can't speak on the latter two, but I've heard that's about when she started going off the deep end.",,Anonymous,,,
